To run this example, adapt the file config.php:
- modify the constant CODE_VIEW_URL by setting your key id
- set the constant SECRET_KEY to your secret key

You can customize this example without changing the files in the subfolders. But you can of course change them for further customization.
In the file index.php, the function validate() must be adapted according to the changes in the file dataForm.php.
