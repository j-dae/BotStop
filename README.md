### PHP CAPTCHA Examples
This repository contains PHP CAPTCHA examples to protect email addresses and forms from robots.
The examples use the free BotStop service.

A **demo** of the examples is available [here](https://botstop.org/en/php).

Each of the three folders *formDialog*, *linkDialog* and *twoPartForm* contains a standalone example.
Within the folders there is a short readme file with installation instructions.

You can either select the example folder that fits your requirements, or
copy the whole root folder to your installation destination. The latter provides a
navigation between the three examples and a link to reset a successful "not a robot verification".
A successful verification is stored in a cookie. To repeat the verification,
this cookie must first be deleted.
