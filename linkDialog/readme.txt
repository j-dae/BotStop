To install this example:
- If not already done: register/login on botstop.org and create an encryption key
- Adapt the file config.php:
  - Modify the constant CODE_VIEW_URL by setting your key id
  - Set the constant SECRET_KEY to your secret key

You can customize this example without changing the files in the subfolders. But you can of course change them for further customization.
